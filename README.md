## A Sinatra Project

### What is the Bravo Personal Score Library Catalogue?
The Bravo Personal Score Library Catalogue is a way for musicians to keep track of the scores in their own personal library. Think of it as the catalogue accessable to you at your local public library, but for your own collection! Add a new score when you acquire it and watch your collection grow and, should you ever need to check what you already own, login and check it out! 

### Installation Guide
- Clone repository
- Run `bundle install` to install all necessary gems
- Run "shotgun" to start up the server
- Either create an account or login to your existing account
- Keep track of your score collection!
